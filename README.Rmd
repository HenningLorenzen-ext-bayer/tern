# tern

The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) as used in clinical trials. We also provide [teal](https://github.roche.com/NEST/teal) modules for outputs in `tern` in the [teal.modules.clinical](https://github.roche.com/NEST/teal.modules.clinical) R package.

* Note that tern can be used to create output for regulatory submissions when used in the enableR system. 
  
* Use of tern in other contexts/systems is for exploratory analysis, quality control, etc.
