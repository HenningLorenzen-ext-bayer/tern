# tern

The `tern` R package contains analysis functions to create tables,
listings and graphs (TLGs) as used in clinical trials. We also provide
[teal](https://github.roche.com/NEST/teal) modules for outputs in `tern`
in the
[teal.modules.clinical](https://github.roche.com/NEST/teal.modules.clinical)
R package.

  - Note that currently **tern may not be used for regulatory
    submissions**

  - However you can use `tern` for exploratory analysis and for quality
    control
