\title{List of Adverse Events Terms Tables}
\usage{
lt_ae_class_term(terms, id, col_by, col_N = tapply(col_by, col_by, length),
  total = "All Patients")
}
\arguments{
\item{terms}{term information as character or factor dataframe, however factor
levels are not repeated by class, only terms with count > 1 are listed per
class. Currently \code{terms} can only be a dataframe with 2 columns.
\code{var_relabel} is used as the character string used as a label in the column header
for each term.}

\item{id}{unique subject identifier. If a particular subject has no adverse
event then that information needs to be added to the \code{col_N} argument.}

\item{col_by}{group variable that will be used for a column header. \code{col_by}
has to be a factor and can not be missing. See 'Examples'.}

\item{col_N}{numeric vector with information of the number of patients in the
levels of \code{col_by}. This is useful if there are patients that have no
adverse events can be accounted for with this argument.}

\item{total}{character string that will be used as a label for a column with 
pooled total population, default is "All Patients". If the levels of col_by are 
the only columns of interest then total should be \code{NULL}}
}
\description{
\code{lt_ae_max_grade_class_term} returns a nested list of adverse events tables 
by unique id (\code{\link{t_count_unique}}).
