\title{List of Events Terms Tables}
\usage{
lt_events_per_term_id_2(terms, id, col_by, col_N, total = "All Patients",
  event_name = "event")
}
\arguments{
\item{terms}{term information as character or factor dataframe, however factor
levels are not repeated by class, only terms with count > 1 are listed per
class. Currently \code{terms} can only be a dataframe with 2 columns.
\code{var_relabel} is used as the character string used as a label in the column header
for each term.}

\item{id}{vector of subject identifier. Length of \code{id} must be the same as the
length or number of rows of \code{terms}.}

\item{col_by}{group variable that will be used for a column header. \code{col_by}
has to be a factor and can not be missing. See 'Examples'.}

\item{col_N}{numeric vector with information of the number of patients in the
levels of \code{col_by}. This is useful if there are patients that have no
adverse events can be accounted for with this argument.}

\item{total}{character string that will be used as a label for a column with 
pooled total population, default is "All Patients". If the levels of col_by are 
the only columns of interest then total should be \code{NULL}}

\item{event_name}{character name of events. Default is "event".}
}
\description{
\code{lt_events_per_term_grade_id_2} returns a nested list of events tables 
by unique id (\code{\link{t_count_unique}}).

\details{
\if{html}{

The data is split and table functions are applied to leaf nodes as follows:
