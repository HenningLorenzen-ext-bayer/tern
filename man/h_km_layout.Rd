\usage{
h_km_layout(data, g_el)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(\code{data.frame})\cr survival data as pre-processed by \code{h_data_plot}.}

\item{g_el}{(\code{list} of \code{gtable})\cr list as obtained by \code{h_decompose_gg()}.}
}
\description{
Prepares a (5 rows) x (2 cols) layout for the Kaplan-Meier curve.
}
\details{
The layout corresponds to a grid of two columns and five rows of unequal
dimensions. Most of the dimension are fixed, only the curve is flexible and
will accommodate with the remaining free space.
\itemize{
\item The left column gets the annotation of the ggplot (y-axis) and the
names of the strata for the patient at risk tabulation.
The main constraint is about the width of the columns which must allow the
writing of the strata name.
\item The right column receive the ggplot, the legend, the x-axis and the
patient at risk table.
